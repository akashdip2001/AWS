# Getting Started with Storage

When you consider running your workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you might first consider your storage options. AWS storage provides the services that you need to build the storage solution that’s right for your business. You will review the primary storage types and the differences between them. You will also learn how to identify the right solution in the cloud based on your requirements. 

You will then focus on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.  Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases. These use cases include websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and big data analytics. 

In this course, you acquire the knowledge that you need to start using Amazon S3. You learn about the key elements of Amazon S3 and explore how to configure them. You learn how to upload data to Amazon S3 and what additional AWS services you can use to transfer data to Amazon S3 at scale. You also learn the basic elements of security within Amazon S3. 

## Course Level 
This course is a foundational level course that is written for learners beginning with cloud computing and AWS services. When you start this course, you don’t need to have a deep knowledge of cloud computing. If you have more knowledge of cloud computing, you might still find this course helpful in refreshing your knowledge and practicing your skills. 

It would be helpful for your learning if you have a basic understanding of cloud computing concepts and the AWS Management Console. AWS Educate supports this background with courses, which include the following:

1. AWS Educate Introduction to the AWS Management Console
2. AWS Educate Introduction to Cloud 101

## Objectives
By the end of this course you will be able to do the following:

- Discuss different types of storage solutions and their features and benefits.
- Discuss the features and concepts of Amazon S3.
- Describe Amazon S3 storage classes and associated use cases.
- Discuss how to use Amazon S3 to create a bucket, upload objects, and work with objects.
- Describe Amazon S3 configurations for cost savings and security.
- Identify other AWS storage solutions and their use cases.
- Use Amazon S3 to create a static website.

## Course Layout
This course is self-paced, and you can take it in as many sessions as you would like. You can stop and come back at any time. The course will hold your progress. 

The course is laid out in three main sections.  

1. The first section is the content module. In this section, you will acquire knowledge and skills related to the content. You should expect to spend about 45 minutes on the content. 
2. The second section is the hands-on simulation where you will get to practice your new skills. The simulation is aligned to the content, and you should know everything that you need in order to complete the simulation. Pay special attention to the simulation directions. You should expect to spend about 45 minutes completing the simulation. 
3. The third section is the final assessment. You must pass the final assessment with a score of 70 percent or better to complete the course and earn a badge. You should expect to spend about 20 minutes completing the final assessment. 

## Getting Started Learning Pathway
This course is part of a series of courses designed to give you a solid foundation in cloud computing. Each course focuses on a specific domain of cloud computing.

Though you can take any of the courses at any time, it is suggested that you take the courses in the following order:
