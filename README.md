=> Wihout OS we can't use computers

=> We have several Operating Systems in the market

 Ex : Windows, Linux, Mac, Solaris, Anroid, IOS
 
============ 
Windows OS  
============

=> Developed By Microsoft company

=> It is GUI based OS

=> It is licensed OS 

=> Single user based OS

=> Security features are less

Note: Anti Virus software we have to install.

=> Windows OS is recommended for personal use

Ex : watch movies, games, browsing, online classes

===========

red hat linux


AWS Account Setup : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi-JDeceLeI

====================
Linux Machine Setup
====================

Approach-1 : Install Linux OS directley in PC

Approach-2 : Install Linux as Guest OS using Virtual Box

Approach-3 : Setup Linux VM in windows using Vagrant

Approach-4 : Take linux vm for rent in cloud platform (AWS)


EC2 service we can use to setup virtual machines in aws cloud.

AWS Free Tier account (1 year)

EC2 : To setup virtual machines 

Monthly : 750 hours free of cost

===============
Lab Practicals
===============

Step-1 : Login into aws account 

Step-2 : Go to EC2 service and launch new instance 

		AMI : amazon linux 
		
		instance type : t2.micro / t3.micro
		
		Keypair : Create new keypair (.pem)
		
Step-3 : Select machine and click on Connect (SSH Client)

Step-4 : Open gitbash from keypair location and execute commands (chmod and ssh)

===================
Linux Architecture
===================

1) Apps / Commands

2) Shell

3) Kernel

4) Hardware components


=> Shell is responsible to validate command given by user and translate that into kernel understandable format.

=> Kernel is one of the core component in linux os. Kernel is responsible to give instructions to hardware to process command execution.

====================
Linux File System
=====================

=> In linux os everything will be represented as file only.

		/
		 /bin
		 /opt
		 /etc
		 /lib
		 /var
		 /mnt
		 /media
		 /home
		 
		 
Note: In Linux VM for every user one home directory will be available like below.

		 
	ec2-user : /home/ec2-user
	
	ashok   : /home/ashok
	
	sita : /home/sita

================	
Linux Commands 
================

pwd: display present working directory.

cd : change directory 

touch : create empty files 

ls : listing the data of pwd

ls -l : long listing with alphabetical order

ls -lr : display files in reverse of alphabetical

ls -lt : display latest files on top

ls -ltr : display old files on top

ls -la : show hidden files also

mkdir : create new directory

rmdir : remove empty directory

rm : remove file 

rm -rf : remove non-empty directories

cat : create file with data + append data + print data

		cat > abc.txt
		
		cat >> abc.txt
		
		cat abc.txt
		
		cat -n abc.txt
		
tac : print data from bottom to top

cp : copy one file to another file

mv : rename + move 

history : display user activities in linux

head : display first 10 lines of the file.

			head f1.txt 
			
			head -n 5 f1.txt 
			
			head -n 100 f1.txt

tail : display last 10 lines of the file.

			tail f1.txt 
			
			tail -n 15 f1.txt
			
			tail -n 50 app.log
			
			tail -f app.log

=========================================
grep : global regular expression print
=========================================

=> It is used for searching data in the file

# print lines which contains ashokit keyword
grep 'ashokit' app.log

# print lines which contains ashokit keyword along with line numbers and ignore case sentivie

grep -n -i 'exception' app.log

# print lines which doesn't contains ashokit keyword

grep -v 'ashokit' app.log

# search for ashokit keyword in last 10 lines
tail app.log | grep 'ashokit'


# search for exception keyword in last 100 lines
tail -n 100 app.log | grep -n -i 'exception'


==========
vi editor 
==========

=> It is used to edit the files in linux os

=> Using vi we can open existing files and we can create new files also.

$ vi java.txt

=> vi command works based on 3 modes

	1) command mode (read data)
	
	2) insert mode (press i in keyword)
	
	3) esc mode (press esc key)
	
	=> save and close (:wq + Enter)
	
	=> close without saving (:q! + Enter)
	
=====================
Networking Commands
=====================

ifconfig : To check IP address of our machine

ping: To check connectivity

		ping www.google.com
		
		ping www.facebook.com 
		
		ping 172.31.4.278

wget: To download files from internet

	wget <url>
	

curl: To send Http request to server 

	curl https://reqres.in/api/users
	
================
User Management	
================

-> Linux OS is a multi user based OS

-> Multiple Users can connect with linux vm at a time.

Note: When we create linux vm using "Amazon Linux" AMI we will get 'ec2-user' as a default user with sudo priviliges.

SUDO : Super user doing operation


# check users available
cat /etc/passwd

# create new user 

Syntax : sudo useradd <username>

Ex : sudo useradd john

# set password for user 

Syntax : sudo passwd <username>

Ex : sudo passwd john

================================
What is sudoers file in linux ?
================================

Note: To give sudo priviliges for the users we need to add them in sudoers file.

# open sudoers file
sudo visudo

Note: Configure user like below (just below root user)

john    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
smith   ALL=(ALL)		ALL

Note: After adding user,  close that file using "CTRL + X + Y + Enter"

===================================================
How to enable password based authentication in linux ?
===================================================

=> In Linux VM by default PasswordAuthentication is disabled.

=> If we want to connect with Linux vm using  username and password we need to enable that.

# open sshd_config file
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

=> Find the Line containing √¢‚Ç¨ÀúPasswordAuthentication√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ parameter and change its value from √¢‚Ç¨Àúno√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ to √¢‚Ç¨Àúyes√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢

Note: save that file and close it using :wq + Enter

# restart sshd service 
sudo service sshd restart

# exit from the machine 
exit

# connect with linux vm usng john user 
# open gitbash 

# execute ssh command
ssh john@public-ip

==================
File Permissions 
==================

=> File permissions are divided into 3 types 

		a) read (r)
		b) write (w)
		c) execute (x)
		
=> File permissions will be represented like below

	Ex : -rwxrwxrwx f1.txt
	     drwxrwxrwx ashokit
	
=> First 3 characters will represent owner permissions (the user who created that file)

=> Middle 3 characters will represent group permissions.

=> Last 3 characters will represent other users permissions.	


Ex:

-rw-r-xr-x f1.txt 

owner => read + write 
group => read + execute 
others => read + execute 

-rwx------ f2.txt 

owner : read + write + execute 
group : Nothing
Others: Nothing


=> To add or remove file permissions we will use 'chmod' command.

# add execute permission for user(owner)
chmod u+x f1.txt 

# remove write permission for user(owner)
chmod u-w f1.txt 

# add write and execute permissions for group
chmod g+wx f1.txt

# remove read permission for others
chmod o-r f1.txt

=> We can represent file permissions using numeric numbers also.

0 => No Permissions 

1 => Execute

2 => Write

3 => (2+1) => Write + Execute 

4 => Read 

5 => (4+1) => Read + Execute 

6 => (4+2) => Read + Write 

7 => (4+2+1) => Read + Write + Execute

# user-read, group-write, others- r+e
chmod 425 f1.txt

# u+rw, g+w, o+we
chmod 623 f1.txt

#u-rwx, g-rwx , o+rwx
chmod 7 f1.txt 

#u-rwx, g+rwx , o+rwx
chmod 77 f1.txt 

======================================
How to change ownership of the file ?
======================================

=> using chown command we can change ownership 

$ sudo chown ashok f1.txt


==================
Package Managers
==================

Package : A software 

=> Package managers are used to manage softwares installation in linux machines.

=> Package Managers are specific to linux distribution.

yum : amazon linux, cent os 

apt : ubuntu , debian

rpm : red hat


# install git 
sudo yum install git -y 
git --version
whereis git

# install java 
sudo yum install java -y
java -version
whereis java

# install maven 
sudo yum install maven -y
maven -version
whereis maven
